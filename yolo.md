# key takeaways
- used new features: Weighted-Residual-Connections (WRC), Cross-Stage-Partial-connections(CSP),  Cross mini-Batch Normalization(CmBN), Self-adversarial-training(SAT), Mish activation, Mosaic data augmentation, CmBN, DropBlock regularization, and CIoU loss, and combine some of them to achieve state-of-the-art results
# Problem and solving
- Problem: The most accurate modern neural networks do not operate in real time and require large number of GPUs for training with a large mini-batch-size.
- Solving: address such problems through creating a CNN that operates in real-time on a conventional GPU, and for which training requires only one conventional GPU.
