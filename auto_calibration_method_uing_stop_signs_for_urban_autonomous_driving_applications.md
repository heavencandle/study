- **Keywords**: auto-calibration, stop signs, urban environments, sensor calibration, autonomous driving, camera calibration

## 1. 연구질문 (Research Question)
- **Trends and Limitations in Previous Research**: Traditional calibration methods require reference patterns, which are not always available during autonomous driving. Existing auto-calibration approaches use vanishing points or markers, but they may fail due to road wear or require structured environments.
- **Necessity or Uniqueness of Research**: This paper proposes using ubiquitous stop signs for auto-calibration in urban autonomous driving, leveraging their standard shape and geometry for accurate sensor recalibration.
- **Research Question**: Can stop signs be effectively used as natural calibration objects to improve autonomous vehicle camera calibration?

## 2. 사용된 이론 및 방법론 (Theories and Methodologies Used)
- **Theories Used**: The calibration uses a pinhole camera model and homography estimation. Recursive updates are made using a Kalman filter for improved temporal accuracy.
- **Research Method**: The system involves detecting stop signs using Mask R-CNN, extracting contour points through color segmentation, fitting lines to edges, refining lines, and estimating corner points for calibration.

## 3. 논문 핵심 (Core of the Paper)
- **Core Research**: The proposed system calibrates cameras in autonomous vehicles by detecting stop signs, utilizing their geometry for real-time updates of intrinsic parameters. The approach adapts well to urban environments and demonstrates robustness in calibration performance through extensive field tests.

## 4. 결론 및 논점 (Conclusion and Discussion)
- **Research Significance and Limitations**: The system achieves reliable calibration performance with minimal errors (around 5%) compared to traditional methods like chessboard calibration. It is suitable for real-world deployment in urban areas but may need improvements in contour detection under poor lighting conditions.
